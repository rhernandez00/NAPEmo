# MR-compatible olfactory stimuli delivery device
 
The device has two main parts: synchronization control and stimuli box.
 
## Synchronization control
 
This part resides outside the scanner, it communicates with an external computer that controls when the stimuli is delivered according to the paradigm.

Note. I made up these names. I'm sure that these parts are called differently.
A) Air intake: receives air from an external source.
B) Quick releaste valve: a valve to completely release the pressure.
C) Pressure regulator valve: modifies the pressure that the device will use inside the system.
D) Electronic valves: these valves are controlled by the electronics inside the box, when the stimuli computer "decides", an electronic signal releases the pressure in this valves and air flows out.
E) Air output: this is the air exit, it should be connected to the silicon tubes that feed air to the stimuli box.
