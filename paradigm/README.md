## Installation

Download a copy of the entire folder into the computer which will run the paradigm. While running it, MATLAB most likely will request to install some additional toolboxes (like the ones related to arduino).

## Usage

Execute NAPEmo02.m and hope for the best.

The program will generate a log file in a "log" folder containing the details of the acquisition.
